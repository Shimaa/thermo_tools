# thermo_tools

A set of tools to calculate thermodynamic properties using thermo properties, also calculate NASA polynomial fitting. 
Another code is for reading the thermo .dat file, calculate the thermo parameters, and update the parameters to do a further step by doing a sensitivity analysis.

This works is developed for CloudFlame system, a cyber-infrastructure by Clean Combustion Research Center, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia
